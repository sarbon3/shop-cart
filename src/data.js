        description:"This unique collection of Richard Scarry’s Little Golden Books brims with colorful cars, droll animals, and a sly fox or two. From fables (“The Country Mouse and the City Mouse”) to folktales (“The Gingerbread Man”) to goodnight stories (Good Night, Little Bear), there are hours of fun for everyone in this beautifully bound book. Favorites such as The Animals of Farmer Jones and The Bunny Book are here, along with stories that have not been available in many years, such as Polite Elephant, Cars and Trucks, Chicken Little, and even Duck and His Friends, which was originally published in 1949. Breathtaking illustrations and stories currently found only in this volume make it a gift to cherish.",
